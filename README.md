# User Experience (UX)
The goal of this website is to create a user-friendly platform where users can get information about Elvira, her specialties, treatment approaches, and contact details.This helps potential clients understand the therapist's expertise and decide if they are the right fit. At the same time, the site serve as a marketing tool to attract new clients thanks to the reviews that users can post, demonstrating the therapist's expertise and highlight their success stories.

## Project Goals

## Agile Methodology
This project was created using Agile principles via a projectboard on Github, where I was able to select which features were still to do, which features were in progress whilst being worked on, and which features met the definition of done. Labels were added to sort the issues based on the importance.
About the user stories, I created based on a Template, which acted as the skeleton for creating new user stories. Each user story would follow the convention:

**As a (role) I can (capability) so that (received_benefit)**

with their respective "Acceptance Criteria" which would need to be met in order for the User Story issue to be marked as Done. The acceptance criteria was very helpful to ensure all necessary tasks were completed, helping me to organise and prioritise my workflow. This has been essential due to the very limited timeframe we had to complete this project.

## Design

### Color Scheme

The colours were selected with the intention of complementing the colors of the logo, in a mix of green and brown. 

### Wireframes
Were created using Balsamiq. The sections below show individual wireframes for different devices:

- Home Page

![img]()

- About/Services

![img]()

- Book an appointment

![img]()

- Post a review

- List of R=rerviews 

### Database Scheme
Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help the developer to make connections between databases and information. Creating an ERD helped me understand how the tables relate to one another and their connection with PostgreSQL Database. I used LucidChart to create the diagram and the arrow represent how the data fields relate to one another.

My booking model and part of the design of my website was inspired  by the blog walkthrough by the Code Institute and the [FreeFido](https://github.com/amylour/FreeFido_v2) and the [thebookbooth1](https://github.com/hiboibrahim/thebookbooth1) projects during my learning of Django. They helped me to get a good and secure grasp of the templating structure and connected Python files to push my features further, make them my own and then develop my Review and Contact Models.

### CRUD
CRUD functionality was implemented in both booking courses and commenting where:

- Create: An authenticated user can create a booking or leaving a comment.
- Read: A user can read the course information and comments .
- Update: An authenticated user can edit and update their own booked courses or comments.
- Delete: An authenticated user can delete their own booked courses or comments.

In this proyect the feature "booking" has full CRUD functionality available whilst "reviews" allows users to CREATE and READ only. I felt unneccessary to add the option of UPDATE or DELETE a review since...............................Post can be deleted form Admin Panel. 

### Data Models

1. AllAuth User Model
- Django Allauth, the User model is the default user model provided by the Django authentication system
- The user can only post a review after having booked an appointment and only leave on review per booking date. 

| User|            |   |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| id |  AutoField | PK|
| username |  CharField|
| email|  EmailField   |   
| password | CharField | 

2. Booking Model 
- A User can have multiple Bookings, but each Booking is associated with only one User. This is represented by the foreign key relationship between User and Booking.
- Full CRUD functionality is available to the user.

| Booking|            |   |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| id |  AutoField | PK|
| first_name |  CharField   |   FK |
| last_name | CharField |  FK    |
| email |  EmailField | FK |
| service|  CharField   |   FK |
| day | DateTime(unique) |    |
| time |  DateTime(unique) |  |
| notes |  TextField |  |

3. Review Model
- Each user can post one review after booking an appointment. This is represented by the foreign key relationship between User and Review.
- Users can leave a review according to the service they booked. This is represented by the foreign key relationship between Service and Review.

| Review|            |   |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| id |  AutoField | PK|
| author |  CharField   |   FK |
| service|  CharField   |   FK |
| created_on | DateTime(unique) | 
| rating| Positive int Field, max=5, min=o   |   
| notes |  RichTextField |  |

4. Service Model 
- The service model is related with the Booking model and the Review model, users can select a service at the momoent of booking an appointment 
- Users can post a review based in the type of service received (Online consultation, Individual or family therapy and workshops)

| Service|            |   |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| id |  AutoField | PK|
| title |  CharField   |   FK |
| description|  TextField   |
| image | CloudinaryField | 

5. Contact Model 
- This model recieves the post requests and saves the data in the database, represented by the foreign key relationship between User and contact form. 

| Contact|            |   |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| id |  AutoField | PK|
| name |  CharField   |   FK |
| email|  EmailField   |   
| query |RichTextField| 
| read|BooleanField  |   

#### Allauth User Model
The User model was built using Django's Allauth library

#### Forking the GitHub Repository
You can fork the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click on Fork button in upper right hand corner

#### Cloning the GitHub Repository

You can clone the repository to use locally by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to clone
2. Click on the code drop down button
3. lick on HTTPS
4. Copy the repository link to the clipboard
5. Open your IDE of choice (git must be installed for the next steps)
6. Type git clone copied-git-url into the IDE terminal

The project will now be cloned locally for you to use.

### ElephantSQL Database
This project uses ElephantSQL for the PostgreSQL Database.

To obtain your own Postgres Database, sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:

Click Create New Instance to start a new database.
Provide a name (this is commonly the name of the project: tribe).
Select the Tiny Turtle (Free) plan.
You can leave the Tags blank.
Select the Region and Data Center closest to you.
Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.

### Cloudinary API
This project uses the Cloudinary API to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

1. For Primary interest, you can choose Programmable Media for image and video API.
2. Optional: edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable.
3. On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your API Environment Variable.
4. Be sure to remove the CLOUDINARY_URL= as part of the API value; this is the key.

#### How to run the project locally 
Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install any applicable packages found within the requirements.txt file.
pip3 install -r requirements.txt. 

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

2. Create a new file called env.py in the main directory.
3. Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY and the Cloudinary URL to env.py file.

Sample env.py file:(Add picture xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)

4. Comment out the default database configuration.
5. Add the Cloudinary and all the rest of libraries you need to the list of installed apps in settings.py
6. Add the STATIC files settings - the url, storage path, directory path, root path, media url and default file storage path.
7. Link the file to the templates directory in Heroku.
8. Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR
9. Add Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list the format ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']
10. Save all files and make necessary migrations. 
python3 manage.py makemigrations
11. Migrate the data to the database:
 python3 manage.py migrate
12. Create a superuser: 
python3 manage.py createsuperuser

Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: 
python3 manage.py runserver

### Heroku Deployment
This project uses Heroku, a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:
Make sure DEBUG = False in the settings.py

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

Create a new file in the main directory called Procfile (do not use any extension for the name of this file)
The Procfile can be created with the following command:

echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile
replace app_name with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located

1. Select New in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select Create new app from the dropdown menu.
2. Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select Create App.
3. From the new app Settings, click Reveal Config Vars, and set your environment variables.
(Add table with keys!!)


Go to the deploy tab on Heroku and connect to GitHub, then to the required repository. 

Scroll to the bottom of the deploy page and either click Enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deploys or Deploy Branch to deploy manually. Manually deployed branches will need re-deploying each time the GitHub repository is updated.
Click 'Open App' to view the deployed live site.

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!
